# repl-pinger
Workflow runs every 10 minutes and "pings" your Repl, hence keeping it up and online!
<br>
Due to Scheduled workflows sometimes being off/delayed, the repl may sleep every so often.

**If you use this yourself, please consider having this in a _public_ repository, so you don't use up your [Private Repo Action Minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#about-billing-for-github-actions) (unless you want to)**
